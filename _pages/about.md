Hi, 

Thanks for checking out this site. My name is Shanshan. I am a data scientist. At days when I'm brave enough I call myself an operations researcher. Even that means less people would know what I do. 

I make a living by solving problems with data, algorithms and working with people. At spare time, I cook, do art projects and try to outsmart my kids by playing Minecraft. 

This site is a place of me sharing useful information, fun projects or anything else.

I hope you find something interesting here. Drop me a note if so.
