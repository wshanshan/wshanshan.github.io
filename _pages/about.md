Hi, Thanks for checking out this website. My name is Shanshan Wang. I'm an industrial engineer living in Chicago. I moved here in late 2016. Before that, I had lived in all kinds cold or hot, dry or humid places. Adaptability is one thing that I'm proud of myself. Another is the picture collection of me in different hues of skin colors.

I develop analytics to improve system efficiency mostly as a consultant. It is a weird profession. It keeps me worrying about others' problems. But I enjoy it. I like the thrills of seeing what I do lead to some kind of improvements in others' lives, or guide people away from mistakes that can be avoided.

My professional training is in Industrial Engineering. I've been practicing simulation, optimization, machine learning for years. As a slave to my own curiority, I'm hands on with Python Flask, GIS map as well. I speak languages of analysts, mathematicians, data scientists, software engineers and even UX designers :smile:. When needed, I wear different hats too. My years of experiences in manufacturing and operations make me see the powers of six sigma, lean, constraint theory. I'm trying to be a practical problem-solver instead of a fancy one. 

I hope you find something interesting here. Drop me a note and I'll reply.
