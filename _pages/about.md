Hi, 

Thanks for checking out this site. My name is Shanshan. I am a data scientist. Some days when I'm brave enough, I call myself an operations researcher, even if it means fewer people know what I do. 

I make a living by solving problems with data, algorithms and working with people. In my spare time, I cook, do art projects and try to outsmart my kids in Minecraft. 

This site is a place for me to share useful information, fun projects or anything else.

I hope you find something interesting here. Drop me a note if so.
