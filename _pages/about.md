Hi, Thanks for checking out this website. My name is Shanshan Wang. I'm an industrial engineer living in Chicago. I moved here in late 2016. Before that, I had lived in all kinds cold or hot, dry or humid places. Adaptability is one thing that I'm proud of myself. Another is the picture collection of me in different hues of skin colors.

I develop analytics to improve system efficiency mostly as a consultant. It is a weird profession. It keeps me worrying about others' problems. But I enjoy it. I like the thrills of seeing what I do lead to some kind of improvements in others' lives, or guide people away from mistakes that can be avoided.

My professional training is in Industrial Engineering. I've been practicing simulation, optimization, machine learning for years. As a slave to my own curiority, I play with math puzzles, Python Flask, maps, AWS... There are way too many fun things around.

I hope you find something interesting here. Drop me a note.
