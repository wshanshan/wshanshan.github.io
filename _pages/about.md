Hi, Thanks for checking out this website. My name is Shanshan. I am an independent data science consultant living in NJ. 

My professional training was in Computer Science and Industrial Engineering. I practiced simulation, optimization, machine learning and managing teams and projects for years in big corporations for more than 10+ years. 

As a slave to my own curiority, I am always trying out new software, solving puzzles and doing some craft ideas. 

I hope you find something interesting here. Drop me a note.
