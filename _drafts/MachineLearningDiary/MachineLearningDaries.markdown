I got asked a lot about the question: Are you familiar with random forest, boosting trees, gradient descent? Do you understand boostrap, cross-validation? Tell me about Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. Do you know how Ridge Regression is trained? Do you know the algorithm that train neural networks?

Terrible terrible question. 

Be a good data scientist should not be equal to reciting a machine learning textbook.
